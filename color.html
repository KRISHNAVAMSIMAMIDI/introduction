        <p>Color in film can build harmony or tension within a scene. Bring attention to a key theme.
            We know that color in filmmaking can be used to tell stories but how? What do 
            the individual colors represent or suggest? 
            And how can they be combined to communicate multi-layered meaning? Let's continue with 
            a quick look at the psychology behind film color .  A well-designed movie color palette 
            evokes mood and sets the tone for the film. 
            When choosing a particular color, remember that there are three main components â€” 
            hue, saturation, and brightness.
