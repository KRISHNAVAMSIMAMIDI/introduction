        <h1>EDITING</h1>
        <P> Film editing as an art form is unique to cinema, though it’s comparable to literary editing,
            where an editor might work by themselves or with the author to transform a manuscript or 
            first draft into a finished version of prose or poetry. The work of the film editor is known
            as “invisible art”—although the editing style is a storytelling device that will shape the film, 
            skillful or artful editing can contribute to the immersive experience of film during which 
            individual edits or editing itself go unnoticed by viewers. To draw the comparison with literature again:
            when engrossed in a novel, readers will follow the story and not pay attention to style or literary and 
            editing techniques.The term film editing refers to the editing process during post-production in filmmaking 
            where the film editor selects film footage from the raw footage to assemble sequences of shots into a 
            finished motion picture, according to an edit decision list or the director’s vision. Film editing is both 
            an art and a skill which involves editing techniques and creativity to craft a cohesive story.
