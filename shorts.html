            Shots are the building blocks of film, and shot selection has a 
            significant impact on the way a viewer interprets the action on screen.
            Itâ€™s important that we choose the right shot to communicate our film 
            effectively.
        

            The camera shot angle is used to specify the location where the camera 
            is placed to take a shot. The position of the camera in relation to the 
            subjects can affect the way the viewer perceives the scene. A scene may 
            be shot simultaneously from multiple camera angles to amplify the 
            cinematic effect and the emotions.
