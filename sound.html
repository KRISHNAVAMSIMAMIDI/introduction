        <p>Sound is important in a production. As previously stated in Chapter Four, 
            different aspects of sound enhance the characters and the story, making 
            the movie a complete experience. In addition, we discussed in the previous 
            chapter that sound is edited into the movie so it is coherent and comprehensible within the movie.

        
            
            Sound in a movie includes music, dialogue, sound effects, ambient noise, and/or background 
            noise and soundtracks. Some sort of sound is always used to enhance the movie experience.
            
            
            Imagine no music in a movie. Certain scenes, like the beginning credits, would have dead air. 
            The movie would seem like it was missing something. Music is a very important element for a movie.
            In the silent movie period, music was played throughout the whole movie. A film score is the music for a movie. 
            The film score is the music at the beginning of the movie when the credits are rolling, and it sets the atmosphere for the movie.
            
            You can feel like you are being whisked away by the music to a land where the movie is taking place.
            
            Music is also played at critical points during a movie.
