        <p>Film editing is both a creative and a technical part of the post-production process of filmmaking. 
            The term is derived from the traditional process of working with film which increasingly involves 
            the use of digital technology. When putting together some sort of video composition, typically, 
            you would need a collection of shots and footages that vary from one another. The act of adjusting 
            the shots you have already taken, and turning them into something new is known as film editing.

            The film editor works with raw footage, selecting shots and combining them into sequences which create a 
            finished motion picture. Film editing is described as an art or skill, the only art that is unique to cinema, 
            separating filmmaking from other art forms that preceded it, although there are close parallels to the 
            editing process in other art forms such as poetry and novel writing. Film editing is an extremely important tool 
            when attempting to intrigue a viewer. When done properly, a film's editing can captivate a viewer and fly completely 
            under the radar. Because of this, film editing has been given the name “the invisible art.”
