        <p>In the early days of cinema, genres were much more uniform and defined. Just as they were in literature and other forms of art and entertainment, people would go to the theater to watch a war film, a musical, or a comedy. The basic genres were well defined and included some of the following:

            Action
            Comedy
            Drama
            Fantasy
            Horror
            Mystery
            Romance
            Thriller
            Western</p>
