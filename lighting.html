        <p>Cinematic lighting is lighting for film that evokes a feeling and has a style. 
            It’s the lighting we see in the movies we watch, be they big budget or 
            independent. While the term cinematic lighting is not a precise term and 
            is in fact very subjective, there are some lighting techniques that generally 
            lead to this look.

            Emulating lighting styles from famous paintings such as Rembrandt or going for a 
            “chiaroscuro” look will give you cinematic lighting. Playing with ratios of lighting 
            within the frame is often the differentiator between cinematic lighting and flat or 
            boring lighting.
            
            Lighting your subject to be slightly or more bright than your background helps draw 
            your eye to the subject. Also, if the subject is a face, lighting the face from behind, 
            opposite the camera (also known as upstage lighting), helps give the subject’s face 
            some more definition as the shadows are falling towards the camera. There are many 
            types of cinematic lighting for film that you can employ to get the mood and shot you want.
